     /*
    * TreeMap is an implementation of the NavigableMap interface in Java, which in turn extends the SortedMap interface.
    *  It stores its elements in key-value pairs similar to other maps. However, the primary distinction is that a TreeMap
    * is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys or by a comparator provided at map creation time.

    Sorted: The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys or by a comparator provided during its creation.
    * This ensures ordered key-value pairs when iterating.

    Key Uniqueness: Like other map implementations, each key in a TreeMap must be unique.

    Doesn't Allow Null: Unlike HashMap and LinkedHashMap, TreeMap doesn't allow null keys. However, it does allow multiple null values.
    * If you attempt to add a null key, it will throw a NullPointerException.

        int applePrice = fruitPrices.get("Apple");
        System.out.println("Price of Apple: " + applePrice); // Price of Apple: 50
