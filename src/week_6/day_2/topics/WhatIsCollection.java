        *  A collection is essentially an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. The Collections framework provides many data
        * structures and algorithms to store and manipulate groups of data in memory.

        Iterable

        Collections

        1> List  -> ArrayList -> LinkedList -> Vector -> Stack
        2> Queue
        3> Set


        Benefits of the Java Collections framework:

        Performance: Implementations are high-performance data structures.
        Flexibility: Since they're based on interfaces, you can use custom implementations if needed.
        Reduces Effort: Don't have to reinvent the wheel; many data structures and algorithms are readily available.
        Quality: Being part of the Java Standard Library means they've been tested and refined over time.
