  /*
    *
    * LinkedList is a part of Java's collection framework (java.util package) and represents a doubly-linked list. In a linked list,
    * each element (known as a node)
    * contains two pieces of information: the data and a reference to the next (and in the case of a doubly-linked list,
    *  the previous) node in the sequence.

    Here are some key characteristics and features of LinkedList in Java:

    Node-Based Structure: Unlike arrays or ArrayList, which use a contiguous block of memory, a LinkedList is composed of
    * individual nodes. Each node contains the
    * data and references to the next and previous nodes.

    Doubly-Linked: Java's LinkedList is a doubly-linked list, which means that each node has a reference to both its next
    * node and its previous node.
    *
    * This allows for bidirectional traversal.


    Dynamic Size: LinkedList can grow or shrink in size dynamically as elements are added or removed.
