// roject Description:
//
//
//The Library Management System will allow users to manage books, members, and borrowing/lending operations.
// The system should support adding and removing books, registering members, issuing and returning books,
// and viewing the current status of all books and members.
//
//Key Functionalities:
//
//
//
//
//Book Management:
//
//A Book class to represent each book. Each book will have attributes like ISBN, title, author,
// publisher, yearOfPublication, and availabilityStatus.
//
//A Library class to manage books, storing all books in a collection (such as ArrayList or HashMap).
//
//
//Member Management:
//
//A Member class to represent library members. Each member will have attributes like memberId,
// name, email, phoneNumber, and a list of borrowed books.
//
//A Library class should also manage members, allowing the addition, removal, and querying of member details.
//
//
//
//Borrowing and Returning Books:
//
//A Transaction class to manage issuing and returning of books.
// This should record details like transactionId, bookISBN, memberId, issueDate, and returnDate.
//
//Methods for borrowing a book (updating its availability and adding it to a member's borrowed books)
// and returning a book (updating its availability and removing it from the memberâ€™s list).
//
//
//
//Collections and Data Structures:
//
//Use ArrayList to maintain lists of books and members.
//
//Use HashMap for quick lookup of books by ISBN and members by member ID.
//
//Use HashSet to ensure unique entries (e.g., ISBN for books).
//
//
//
//Advanced Features (Optional for Extra Practice):
//
//Search functionality for books based on different attributes (e.g., title, author).
//
//Track overdue books and notify members.
//
//
