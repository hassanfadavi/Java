//    Student Management System
//
//
//
//Objective:
//To develop a student management system that allows managing students, courses, and enrollments using OOP principles and collections. The project should focus on encapsulating data, using inheritance for various types of courses and students, applying polymorphism for course behavior, and utilizing collections for managing lists of students and courses.
//
//
//Project Description:
//The system will allow a user to manage student profiles, courses, and enrollments. It will also calculate the grade point average (GPA) of students based on their course performance. The system will store students and courses in collections and provide functionalities for searching, adding, and removing these entities.
//
//
//
//Key Functionalities:
//
//
//
//Student Management:
//
//A Student class representing a student, with attributes like studentId, name, email, phoneNumber, and a list of enrolledCourses.
//
//A GraduateStudent and UndergraduateStudent class inheriting from Student to demonstrate polymorphism and inheritance.
//
//A method to calculate GPA based on the courses a student is enrolled in.
//
//
//
//Course Management:
//
//A Course class representing a course, with attributes like courseId, courseName, credits, and grade.
//
//A MandatoryCourse and ElectiveCourse class extending Course to apply inheritance and to demonstrate different behaviors based on course type.
//
//Methods to add or remove students from a course.
//
//
//
//Enrollment and Data Management:
//
//A CourseEnrollment class to track the enrollment of students in courses.
//
//Use of ArrayList to maintain a list of students and courses.
//
//Use of HashMap to quickly look up courses by course ID or students by student ID.
//
//
//
//Collections and Data Structures:
//
//Store Student and Course objects in ArrayList.
//
//Use HashMap to associate student IDs with student objects and course IDs with course objects.
//
//
//
//Advanced Features (Optional for Extra Practice):
//
//Search for students by name or course by title.
//
//Calculate average grade for a course and list all students enrolled in a specific course.
//
//
//
//When you add or remove data from the system, the information should be added to a txt file,
//so next time when you run your program, the previous data should be available.
