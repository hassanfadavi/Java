//Question 8: Dynamic String Lengths
//
//Task:
//Create a string with the initial value "Java".
// Add another word to this string, such as "Programming", by concatenating it.
// Before and after concatenating, use the length() method to calculate the length of the string.
// Print both lengths and describe the change.
//
//Expected Outcome:
//Students should observe how the length changes dynamically when new content is added to a string.


       String str1= "Java"+"Programming";


        System.out.println(str1.length());

    }
