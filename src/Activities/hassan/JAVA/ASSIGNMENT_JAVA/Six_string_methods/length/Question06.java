//Question 6: Hidden Lengths
//
//Task:
//Create a string that includes leading and trailing spaces, such as " Java ".
// Without removing the spaces, use the length() method to determine the length of the string.
// Then, explain how the length changes if the spaces are removed from the start and end of the string.
//
//Expected Outcome:
//Students should observe that spaces count towards the total length and compare the
// results with the length of the trimmed string.


        System.out.println(" Java ".length());
        System.out.println(" Java ".trim().length());
