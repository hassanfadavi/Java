//    Objective: Understand the use of encapsulation for creating a configuration module.
//
//Steps:
//
//    1. Create a class called AppConfig.
//    2. Define private member variables to store configuration details, like serverIP, port, databaseName, etc.
//    3. Implement public setter and getter methods for each of these member variables.
//    4. Ensure that specific configuration values, like port, are within valid ranges (e.g., 0-65535) when being set.
//    5. In a main method, create an AppConfig object, set its parameters, and display them.
